# YCSL-Event-data

There are two datasets, diff-objects and SLAM data. The first dataset involves the movement of five different shaped objects, individually or in groups, undergoing four types of motion: swinging, rolling, throwing, and colliding. The second dataset is created for SLAM testing and includes two cameras (a regular frame-based camera and an event-based Dynamical Visual Sensor (DVS) camera) simultaneously capturing multiple indoor and outdoor scenarios. The indoor dataset features different floors of a campus building, while the outdoor dataset was recorded around the campus.

And the second SLAM dataset is about 10GB large, pls contact gjiang@students.kennesaw.edu for datasets.
